# SurveyProspector
Open Source R/Shiny Data Mining Application
## Installation
Everything that you need is free, and can be downloaded in a few minutes.
1. R from http://www.r-project.org/
2. RStudio from http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
3. The three source files in this repository that end with .R. 

Create a folder somewhere called Survey Prospector, and put the three .R files in it. Then launch RStudio and load the necessary libraries by running at the command prompt (lower left window):

install.packages(c("shiny","binom,"dplyr","tidyr","igraph","ggvis"))

Now use the File menu to find and open ui.R in the Survey Prospector folder. Look for a green arrow with "Run App" near the top of the screen. Click that to run the app.

A recent AALHE webinar using this application was recorded, and you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SovUNRfG8M&feature=youtu.be. There are other videos here: http://highered.blogspot.com/2014/07/survey-prospector.html.
